## üöÄ Features

- **Massive Particle Simulation:**
  - Starts with **10,000 objects** by default, creating a rich and dense environment.
  - The number of objects can be easily adjusted to suit your preferences or hardware capabilities.

- **Realistic Physics:**
  - Particles experience gravitational forces and are attracted to the sun regardless of their distance.
  - Collisions between particles result in merging, with masses and velocities adjusted according to conservation laws.

- **Orbital Mechanics:**
  - Particles are initialized with tangential velocities, causing them to orbit the sun realistically.
  - Initial velocities can be scaled to create more energetic orbits.

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - **Smooth Exit:** Press the `ESC` key or close the window to gracefully exit the simulation.

- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - **Spatial Partitioning:** Utilizes a grid-based neighbor search to optimize force calculations, significantly reducing computational complexity.
  - **Distance Culling:** Gravitational forces are only calculated between nearby particles, enhancing performance without sacrificing visual accuracy.
  - **Object Cleanup:**
    - Particles that move far from the sun are removed to maintain simulation efficiency.
    - Inactive particles resulting from collisions are cleaned up in the background.
  - **Multithreading:** Simulation runs efficiently, handling large numbers of particles smoothly.

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Run the Simulation:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Simulation:**

   - **Exit Simulation:** Press the `ESC` key or click the close button on the window to exit smoothly.
   - **Adjust Parameters:** Modify variables in the `main.py` and `spaceManager.py` files to change the number of particles, initial velocities, and other settings.

---

## üîß Configuration

You can customize the simulation by adjusting parameters in the `main.py` and `spaceManager.py` files:

### In `main.py`:

- **Number of Objects:**

  ```python
  NUM_OBJECTS = 10_000  # Adjust the number of particles
  ```

- **Screen Mode:**

  ```python
  screen = pygame.display.set_mode((0, 0), pygame.FULLSCREEN)  # Fullscreen mode
  # To use windowed mode, specify dimensions:
  # screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
  ```

### In `spaceManager.py`:

- **Initial Velocity Scale:**

  ```python
  space_manager = SpaceManager(velocity_scale=2.0)  # Increase for higher initial velocities
  ```

- **Collision Distance:**

  ```python
  self.collision_distance = 5  # Adjust for collision sensitivity
  ```

- **Gravitational Constant:**

  ```python
  G = 1e-3  # Modify to change gravitational strength
  ```

- **Particle Mass Range:**

  ```python
  self.obj_mass = np.abs(np.random.randn(self.numObjects) * 10)  # Adjust mass distribution
  ```

## üìà Optimizations

- **Grid-Based Neighbor Search:**
  - Particles are organized into a grid to limit force calculations to nearby neighbors.
  - Reduces computational complexity from O(N¬≤) to approximately O(N).

- **Distance-Based Force Calculation:**
  - Gravitational forces are only calculated for particles within a certain distance.
  - Ensures that distant particles do not unnecessarily consume computational resources.

- **Inactive Particle Cleanup:**
  - Particles that are too far from the sun or have merged are removed from active calculations.
  - Keeps the simulation running smoothly as particles merge and the number of active particles decreases.

- **Efficient Rendering:**
  - Particles are drawn as circles with radii proportional to the cube root of their mass.
  - Inactive particles are effectively removed from the screen to maintain visual accuracy.

## üìù Code Overview

### `main.py`

- **Initialization:**
  - Sets up the Pygame environment and creates a fullscreen window.
  - Retrieves the screen dimensions to pass to the `SpaceManager`.
- **Simulation Loop:**
  - Runs the main loop that keeps the simulation running.
  - Handles user input to allow for a smooth exit using the `ESC` key.
  - Calls the `iterate` function from `SpaceManager` to update the simulation each frame.

### `spaceManager.py`

- **`SpaceManager` Class:**
  - Manages all aspects of the simulation, including particle initialization, force calculations, collision handling, and rendering.
- **Key Methods:**
  - `__init__`: Initializes particles, assigns initial positions and velocities, and sets up simulation parameters.
  - `iterate`: Updates particle positions and velocities, handles collisions, and renders particles on the screen.
- **Physics Implementation:**
  - **Gravitational Forces:** Calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation, optimized with spatial partitioning.
  - **Collision Handling:** Detects when particles are close enough to collide and merges them, conserving mass and momentum.
  - **Velocity Initialization:** Particles start with tangential velocities for realistic orbital motion, with a scalable velocity factor.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Compatibility:**
  - Ensure that your Python version is compatible with the libraries used, especially Numba and Pygame.
- **Performance:**
  - Simulating a large number of particles can be computationally intensive. Adjust `NUM_OBJECTS` in `main.py` according to your system's capabilities.
- **Fullscreen Mode:**
  - The simulation runs in fullscreen by default. To run it in windowed mode, modify the `pygame.display.set_mode` call in `main.py`.
